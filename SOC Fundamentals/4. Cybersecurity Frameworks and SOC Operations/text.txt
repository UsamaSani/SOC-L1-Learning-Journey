Cybersecurity Frameworks and SOC Operations
Core Frameworks
Cyber Kill Chain
The Cyber Kill Chain describes the typical lifecycle of a cyberattack through seven stages:
1.	Reconnaissance - Gathering information about targets
2.	Weaponization - Creating malicious payloads
3.	Delivery - Transmitting the payload to the target
4.	Exploitation - Executing code to gain initial foothold
5.	Installation - Establishing persistent presence
6.	Command & Control (C2) - Maintaining communication channels
7.	Action on Objectives - Achieving strategic goals (data exfiltration, privilege escalation, lateral movement)
MITRE ATT&CK Framework
A practical knowledge base cataloging attacker behaviors rather than specific malware or tools. It encompasses 14 tactics with varying techniques, including:
•	Reconnaissance (11 techniques)
•	Initial Access (11 techniques)
•	Execution (17 techniques)
•	Persistence (23 techniques)
•	Defense Evasion (47 techniques)
•	Credential Access (17 techniques)
•	Lateral Movement (9 techniques)
•	Exfiltration (9 techniques)





TTPs vs IOCs
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) describe how attackers think, act, and operate. They reveal the "how" and "why" behind attacks, enabling SOC analysts to detect threats even when IOCs change and build better detection playbooks.
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are observable evidence of system compromise, categorized as:
1.	Network-Based - Malicious IPs, suspicious domains, C2 communications
2.	Host/Endpoint-Based - Suspicious processes, registry changes, scheduled tasks
3.	File-Based - File hashes, name patterns, size anomalies
4.	Email-Based - Malicious sender emails, phishing subject lines
Key Difference: IOCs show "what happened" (short-lived evidence), while TTPs show "how it happened" (long-lived behavior patterns).
Alert Triage Process
Alert triage is the structured process of quickly analyzing security alerts to separate real attacks from false alarms. 
Prioritization Rules:
1.	Filter alerts - Take only new, unassigned alerts
2.	Sort by severity - Critical, High, Medium, Low
3.	Sort by time - Address oldest alerts first
Initial Actions:
•	Assign alert to yourself
•	Move to "in-progress" status
•	Review alert details, description, and key indicators
Alert Properties: Include alert time, name, severity, status, verdict (True/False Positive), assignee, description, and relevant contextual fields.
Workflow: Event occurs → System logs event → Logs sent to SIEM/EDR → Alert generated → SOC analyst triages → Decision: True Positive or False Positive → Escalation or Closure
Effective triage reduces false positives, catches real threats early, and ensures SOC efficiency and business protection.

1. Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) in SOC
TTPs describe how attackers think, act, and operate during cyber-attacks.
•	If an IOC tells you what happened, TTPs tell you how and why it happened
•	SOC analysts use TTPs to:
o	Detect threats even when IOCs change
o	Understand attacker intent
o	Build better detections, alerts, and response playbooks

2. Cyber Kill Chain (7 Stages)
The lifecycle of a cyberattack, showing where defenders can detect, block, or disrupt.
Stage	Name	Description
1	Reconnaissance	Gather target info, find weaknesses/entry points
2	Weaponization	Turn intel into tailored payloads to evade defenses
3	Delivery	Send payload (email, links, media, drive-by)
4	Exploitation	Execute delivered artifact, exploit vuln/user action, gain foothold
5	Installation	Establish persistence (malware/backdoors)
6	Command & Control (C2)	Maintain comms for commands/exfiltration
7	Action on Objectives	Exfiltrate data, escalate, move laterally, sabotage, or maintain access

3. MITRE ATT&CK
A practical, behavior-focused framework cataloging what attackers do and how.
Tactic	Technique Count
Reconnaissance	11
Resource Development	8
Initial Access	11
Execution	17
Persistence	23
Privilege Escalation	14
Defense Evasion	47
Credential Access	17
Discovery	34
Lateral Movement	9
Collection	17
Command & Control	18
Exfiltration	9
Impact	15
________________________________________
4. Three Layers
Tactics (WHY)
Common attacker goals:
Tactic	Meaning
Initial Access	How attacker first gets in
Execution	Run malicious code
Persistence	Stay in system
Privilege Escalation	Become admin
Defense Evasion	Avoid AV/EDR
Credential Access	Steal passwords
Lateral Movement	Move to other systems
Exfiltration	Steal data
Techniques (HOW)
Examples for Credential Access:
•	Keylogging
•	Credential dumping (LSASS)
•	Browser password theft
•	Phishing for credentials
Procedures (Steps/Tools/Commands/Timing)
Example:
•	Technique: Credential Dumping
•	Procedure: procdump.exe -accepteula -m lsass.exe lsass.dmp
Most SOCs map TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK (used by SIEM/EDR/XDR)

5. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Observable evidence of compromise.
"Something bad happened here and we can prove it with data"
Sources:
•	Logs
•	Network traffic
•	Endpoint activity
•	Email headers
•	File systems
Uses:
•	Trigger SIEM alerts
•	Confirm activity
•	Correlate across systems
•	Respond (block/isolate)
•	Write reports
________________________________________
6. Four Types of IOCs
Network-Based
•	Malicious IPs
•	Suspicious domains
•	C2 communications
•	Unusual ports/protocols
Where seen: Firewall/proxy/DNS logs, IDS/IPS
Host/Endpoint-Based
•	Suspicious processes
•	Unexpected services
•	Registry changes
•	New scheduled tasks
Where seen: EDR/XDR, Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Linux audit logs
File-Based
•	Hashes (MD5/SHA256)
•	Name patterns
•	Size anomalies
Where seen: AV, EDR, email gateways, sandboxes
Email-Based
•	Malicious sender
•	Phishing subjects
•	Malicious URLs
•	Header anomalies
Where seen: Email security, Microsoft Defender, Proofpoint/Mimecast, user reports
________________________________________
7. IOC Confidence Levels
Level	Example
Low	Single suspicious IP
Medium	Known phishing domain
High	Malware hash + execution
Very High	Multiple correlated IOCs
________________________________________
8. IOCs vs TTPs
Aspect	IOCs	TTPs
Type	Evidence	Behavior
Answers	What happened	How it happened
Lifespan	Short-lived	Long-lived
Changeability	Easy to change	Hard to change
Usage	Alerts	Detection logic
________________________________________
9. Alert Triage
A structured process to quickly judge alerts as real, false, or escalate - separating real attacks from noise accurately.
"SOC analysts are promoted based on triage quality, not number of alerts closed."
Flow:
Events occur -> Systems log -> Logs ship to SIEM/EDR -> Alerts highlight suspicious sequences -> Analysts triage dozens of alerts instead of millions of logs
________________________________________
10. Why Triage Is Critical
Without Triage	With Triage
Drown in alerts	Fewer false positives
Miss attacks	Early catches
Delayed response	Efficient/trusted SOC
Higher business impact	-
Triage decides whether an alert becomes an incident.
________________________________________
11. Alert Properties
Property	Description	Example
Alert Time	When generated	Mar 21, 15:35
Alert Name	Trigger summary	Unusual login location
Alert Severity	Urgency level	Low/Medium/High/Critical
Alert Status	Lifecycle stage	New/In-Progress/Closed
Alert Verdict	L1 outcome	True Positive/False Positive
Alert Assignee	Handling analyst	Assigned Analyst name
Alert Description	Explanation	Detailed suspicious activity
Alert Fields	Context	Affected hostname, entered command line, etc.
________________________________________
12. Alert Prioritization
1.	Filter Alerts: Take only new/unseen/unresolved, not owned by others
2.	Sort by Severity: Critical -> High -> Medium -> Low
3.	Sort by Time: Oldest first - older breaches likely progressed further
________________________________________
13. Real SOC Flow
IOC detected (IP/hash/process) -> SIEM alert -> L1 validates IOCs -> Map to TTP -> Decision (TP/FP) -> Escalate or close
________________________________________
