# SOC-L1-Learning-Journey

**Documenting My Path to Becoming a SOC Analyst**

---

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey learning Security Operations Center (SOC) operations and defensive cybersecurity. As I progress through various topics, tools, and scenarios, I'm creating detailed study guides and interactive learning materials to reinforce my understanding and share knowledge with the community.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- **Document Learning Progress**: Create structured notes and guides for each topic I study
- **Build Practical Understanding**: Develop interactive web sessions to practice concepts hands-on
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide free resources for others beginning their cybersecurity journey
- **Track Growth**: Maintain a clear record of skills acquired and topics mastered
- **Community Contribution**: Give back to the cybersecurity learning community

Each session folder contains:
- **PDF Guide**: Comprehensive study notes on the topic
- **README**: Detailed explanation of concepts covered
- **References**: Links to additional resources and tools
- **Practice Scenarios**: Real-world examples and case studies

## Learning Approach

### Dual Documentation Method

I'm using a two-pronged approach to maximize retention and understanding:

1. **PDF Study Guides**
   - Detailed written notes from learning sessions
   - Visual diagrams and workflow examples
   - Tool demonstrations and screenshots
   - Key concepts and frameworks

2. **Interactive Web Sessions**
   - Hands-on practice environments
   - Simulated attack scenarios
   - Tool demonstrations
   - Real-time learning exercises

### Progressive Learning Path

This documentation follows a structured progression:

**Phase 1: Foundations**
- SOC fundamentals and operations
- Common attack vectors
- Alert triage methodologies
- Essential tools overview

**Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive**
- SIEM platform mastery
- EDR/XDR technologies
- Log analysis techniques
- Threat intelligence integration

**Phase 3: Advanced Operations**
- Incident response procedures
- Threat hunting methodologies
- Advanced persistent threats
- Forensics fundamentals

## How to Use This Repository

### For Learners
1. Start with Session 01 to build foundational knowledge
2. Read through the PDF guides at your own pace
3. Use the interactive sessions to practice concepts
4. Refer back to materials as needed during your studies

### For Educators

## Interactive Learning Platform

Alongside these documentation guides, I'm developing an interactive web-based learning platform using the MERN stack. This platform will feature:

- Real-time attack simulations
- Interactive SIEM dashboards
- Hands-on alert triage exercises
- Progress tracking and skill assessments
- Community-driven learning paths

**Status**: Under active development. Will be made publicly available upon completion.

The screenshots and examples shown in the PDF guides are taken from this interactive platform, demonstrating practical applications of the concepts discussed.
